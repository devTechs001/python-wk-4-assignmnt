# Python Week 4 Assignment

## Overview
This project involves working with Python's file handling capabilities. The main objectives are to:
- Read the content of an input file (`input.txt`).
- Modify the content programmatically.
- Write the modified content to a new output file (`output.txt`).
- Handle potential errors gracefully, such as missing or inaccessible files.


## Project Structure
The repository contains the following files:
- **`main.py`**: The Python script that implements the assignment logic.
- **`input.txt`**: A sample input file containing text to be read and processed.
- **`output.txt`**: The file where modified content is saved.
